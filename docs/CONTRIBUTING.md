# Contributing to Presence

This repository contains a number of projects representing libraries, command line tools, and tests. There are lots of ways to contribute - and if you'd like to do so, you're very welcome.

It's intended to be a general purpose library, so if you feel like you have a use case that's not being addressed, find a way to help make it happen.

## Budding coders

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

If you wish to contribute, but aren't sure where to start - take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/instantiator/presence/issues) for any that are marked as `good first issue` or `help wanted` - these will be especially welcome. (This project is just getting started, but there are bound to be some in the future!)

## Bugs

If you'd like to report a bug, [create a new issue](https://github.com/instantiator/presence/issues/new), and share what you've found. It's really helpful to add code or steps that will help to reproduce the issue.

## Feature suggestions

If you'd like to suggest new features, similarly, [create a new issue](https://github.com/instantiator/presence/issues/new) with your suggestion. There's no guarantee it'll be implemented, but it will be considered.

You're welcome to submit a pull request with your suggested changes - and this will also be taken into consideration. (Do please add lots of context to your PR description!)

## Code of conduct

The open source community should be a safe place for everyone. Racism, mysoginy, sexism, bullying, or any form of cruelty is not welcome here - please [raise an issue](https://github.com/instantiator/presence/issues/new) to report it if you encounter it.
